A python programm to scan Links in Emails using the VirusTotal API. 
Right now it only supports gmail. For it to work you need a VirusTotal api key, a gmail account and a app password for said gmail account.
All of these you need to save in a os variable/envirment variable.

Credits to my uncle for the gui and to ChatGPT for trubble shooting when VirusTotal libary din't install correctly.
